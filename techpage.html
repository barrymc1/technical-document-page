                Website development is a catch-all term for the work that goes into building a website. This includes
                everything from markup and coding to scripting, network configuration, and CMS development.

                While web development typically refers to web markup and coding, website development includes all
                related
                development tasks, such as client-side scripting, server-side scripting, server and network security
                configuration, eCommerce development, and content management system (CMS) development.

            <p>Front-end (or client-side) is the side of a website or software that you see and interact with as an
                Internet
                user. When website information is transferred from a server to a browser, front-end coding languages
                allow
                the website to function without having to continually “communicate” with the Internet.</p>
            <p>
                Front-end code allows users to interact with a website and play videos, expand or minimize images,
                highlight
                text, and more. Web developers who work on front-end coding work on client-side development.

                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For
                example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using
                images
                and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its
                functions.
            </p>
            <p> Anatomy of an HTML element

            <ul>
                <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and
                    closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case
                    where the paragraph begins.</li>
                <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before
                    the
                    element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to
                    add
                    a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
                <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
            </ul>

            </p>

            <p>

                <code class="code-box">function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>

            <p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need
                to
                get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a
                certain
                location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>
            <p>
                Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet
                language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects
                paragraph
                text, setting the color to red:
                <code class="code-box">
             p {
                 color: red;
              }

            <p>
                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language.
                Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                its
                environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language
                elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                    For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                    clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                    server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                    another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                    server.
                </li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <p>
                By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                <code class="code-box">x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
                generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                variant.
            </p>

            <p>
                <code class="code-box">function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>
